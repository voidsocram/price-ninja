# Price Ninja

Price Ninja is a project aimed at creating a web page that extracts product information from various popular websites, such as PcComponentes or Última Informática. Its primary goal is to provide users with an intuitive interface to visualize price changes for each product over time. Additionally, it will offer a detailed price history, including the option to display prices with IGIC instead of IVA for users.
